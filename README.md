## What I Do

- I enjoy ideating and building quickly, especially when ideas can be tested end-to-end in working systems.  
- Python for ML and backend work, TypeScript or JavaScript for application logic and interfaces, and PostgreSQL for persistence.  
- My ML interests include NLP, LLM systems, evaluation methodology, and fairness.  
- I care about containerized services, cloud deployment, observability, and building things that are debuggable in production.  
- I spend a lot of time on data pipelines, feature construction, and error analysis rather than model-only iteration.

## Experience

Software Engineer @ hGrid  
Delivery Data Engineer @ Turing  
Intern @ Arista Networks  

In addition to industry roles, much of my work has been research-driven or self-directed, usually motivated by gaps I noticed in how systems and operations are run, evaluated, or deployed.
