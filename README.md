## Sujit Mandava

MS in Artificial Intelligence candidate at Northwestern University.  
Computer Science graduate from IIT Palakkad.

I build applied machine learning and systems-heavy AI products, with emphasis on:
- LLM systems, RAG, and AI governance
- ML pipelines, evaluation, and observability
- Data-centric and infrastructure-aware ML

## Selected Work

**ShadowAI – AI Usage Governance & Egress Control**
- Built a proxy-layer system to monitor and control enterprise LLM usage.
- Captures prompts, tool calls, and outputs to detect IP leakage and policy violations.
- Focus on minimal latency, OpenAI-compatible APIs, and production deployability.
- Stack: Python, FastAPI, Docker, Nginx, LLM APIs.

**Staleness-Aware RAG**
- Designed a retrieval system that tracks document freshness and knowledge decay.
- Prevents outdated context from dominating LLM responses.
- Evaluated retrieval quality under time-based drift.
- Stack: Python, vector databases, custom evaluators.

**ML Fairness & Disinformation Detection**
- Trained and evaluated classifiers on globally skewed datasets.
- Analyzed performance disparities across geopolitical regions.
- Emphasis on evaluation metrics over raw accuracy.
