## Sujit Mandava

MS in Artificial Intelligence, Northwestern University  
B.Tech in Computer Science, IIT Palakkad

I build applied ML and AI systems with a focus on production constraints, evaluation, and governance.  
My work sits at the intersection of LLM systems, ML infrastructure, and responsible deployment.

## Selected Projects

**ShadowAI — Enterprise AI Usage Governance**
- Designed a proxy-layer control plane for monitoring and enforcing policy on LLM usage.
- Captures prompts, tool calls, and outputs to detect IP leakage, policy violations, and misuse.
- OpenAI-compatible gateway with minimal latency impact.
- Stack: Python, FastAPI, Docker, Nginx, cloud deployment.

**Staleness-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation**
- Built a RAG system that tracks document freshness and mitigates knowledge decay.
- Prevents outdated sources from dominating retrieval results.
- Focus on evaluation under temporal drift rather than static accuracy.
- Stack: Python, vector databases, custom evaluators.

**Disinformation & Fairness Analysis**
- Trained classifiers on globally skewed datasets.
- Analyzed performance disparities across regions rather than aggregate metrics.
- Emphasis on evaluation rigor and failure modes.
